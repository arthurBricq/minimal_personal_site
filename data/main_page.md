### A little bit about me

I am a **software engineer** coming from the world of robot's localization, but at ease with all aspects of software
engineering. Now, I am working in the field of distributed computing.

Languages where I am the most at ease includes **C++, Java & Python**. My favorite language is **Rust**,
with which I do all my side-projects.

Here, you'll find some personal projects that I have done, some ways to contact me, and (maybe if I have time) some
thoughts and opinions that I have to share (*As it happens, I am a nature lover that is pretty scared about our future
due to the climate crisis and I would like to write about it*)

### Personal links

- [My Github account](https://github.com/arthurBricq) contains the code that I am allowed to share.
- [My LinkedIn account](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arthur-bricq-737548153/)
- [My lichess account](https://lichess.org/@/arthurbricq) if you want to play chess games with me ♟️

### Even more about me

I am passionate about what I do: programming and computer-science. I like the most Rust and C++ but really, any kind of
programming is cool. In the last few years, I programmed in my free time **two chess engines** with a UI to play with
them, a **text editor**, a **3D game-engine**, a **website generator** (*used to build this site*), participated in
several coding challenges such as **advent-of-codes**, the google's FooBar challenge or Euler project.

In the rest of my free time, I like

- All kind of carbon-free muscle-powered travels: hiking, trekking, biking, bike touring, ski touring
- Endurance sports: running, trail running, cycling
- Photography
- Playing chess
- Reading books about fantasies or fictions or ecology
- Good beers, good people, good coffee
- Camping outside, with or without tent

### Why a personal website ?

As you can understand, this personal website is not a resume (*though, you can find my resume here !*), nor is it
limited to a port-folio (*though, you find many of my projects here!*). I don't really know what it is about, to be very
honest.

For most of my life, I was considered (and probably still am) as a nerd. **Nerds have personal websites**! I have loved
technologies for all of my life (especially everything that involves computers), but I am also deeply scared for the
future of another one of my favorite things on earth: the earth. Maybe this is a trial to see if I can (to some
extremely limited extent) join both attractions.

### More about how this page was built

This is my attempt to write an **extremely lightweight**, yet pleasant, personal website. It uses only the basics: *
*HTML**, **CSS** and (at the moment) not a single JS file. All of the this website is automatically generated from
sources written in markdown, that are parsed using a small python script and then exported to their .html equivalent.

I use to have a personal website (which I was very happy about) written with
the [React framework gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/). After not touching the code for 1 year and a half, it happened
to have **195 broken dependencies**. Just that. This experience made me mad about the current state of these newly shiny
JS frameworks, and I ended up writing a personal website without any JS dependency.

It's simple. It works today. It would have worked 10 years ago. I hope it will work in 10 years.
