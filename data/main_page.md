### A little bit about me

I am a **software engineer** coming from the world of robot's localization, but at ease with all aspects of software
engineering. Now, I am working in the field of distributed computing.

The language that I enjoy the most, that I do most side projects with, and that I work with, is **Rust**. I am also very
at ease with **C++**, **Java** and **Python**.

Here, you'll find some personal projects that I have done, some ways to contact me, and (maybe if I have time) some
thoughts and opinions that I have to share (*As it happens, I am a nature lover that is pretty scared about our future
due to the climate crisis and I would like to write about it*)

### A pledge for writing useless projects

This website can be seen as a portfolio, but I would rather see it as a memorial to all the time that I have spent 
programing what I like to call "*my useless projects*".

As you will find out if you look at my projects... I *really* like to rewrite stuffs from scratch in Rust. Especially
if these things involves some games. Like chess, like minecraft, or like the gameboy. I am convinced that there is an
incredible value in doing useless programming project that nobody will never use but that you have fun doing and looking
back at. So here it is, I hope you enjoy these projects ! And here's to many useless projects.

### Personal links

- [My Github account](https://github.com/arthurBricq) contains the code that I am allowed to share.
- [My LinkedIn account](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arthur-bricq-737548153/)
- [My lichess account](https://lichess.org/@/arthurbricq) if you want to play chess games with me ♟️

### Even more about me

I am passionate about what I do: programming and computer-science. I like the most Rust and C++ but really, any kind of
programming is cool. In the last few years, I programmed in my free time **two chess engines** with a UI to play with
them, a **text editor**, a **3D game-engine**, a **website generator** (*used to build this site*), participated in
several coding challenges such as **advent-of-codes**, the google's FooBar challenge or Euler project.

In the rest of my free time, I like

- All kind of carbon-free muscle-powered travels: hiking, trekking, biking, bike touring, ski touring
- Endurance sports: running, trail running, cycling
- Photography
- Playing chess
- Reading books about fantasies or fictions or ecology
- Good beers, good people, good coffee
- Camping outside, with or without tent

### Why a personal website ?

As you can understand, this personal website is not a resume (*though, you can find my resume here !*), nor is it
limited to a port-folio (*though, you find many of my projects here!*). I don't really know what it is about, to be very
honest.

For most of my life, I was considered (and probably still am) as a nerd. **Nerds have personal websites**! I have loved
technologies for all of my life (especially everything that involves computers), but I am also deeply scared for the
future of another one of my favorite things on earth: the earth. Maybe this is a trial to see if I can (to some
extremely limited extent) join both attractions.

### More about how this page was built

This is my attempt to write an **extremely lightweight**, yet pleasant, personal website. It uses only the basics: *
*HTML**, **CSS** and (at the moment) not a single JS file. All of the this website is automatically generated from
sources written in markdown, that are parsed using a small python script and then exported to their .html equivalent.

I use to have a personal website (which I was very happy about) written with
the [React framework gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/). After not touching the code for 1 year and a half, it happened
to have **195 broken dependencies**. Just that. This experience made me mad about the current state of these newly shiny
JS frameworks, and I ended up writing a personal website without any JS dependency.

It's simple. It works today. It would have worked 10 years ago. I hope it will work in 10 years.
