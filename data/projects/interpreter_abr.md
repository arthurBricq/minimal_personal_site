# Interpreter in Rust

It was very fun to write an interpreter and to design from scratch a programming language.

Of course, this little toy interpreter is not yet completely usable (missing how to read files...) but it is quite functional. In the examples section, you can find how to write the Fibonnaci function with either a loop or with a recursive function.
