# Minecraft Clone

I've always wondered what it took to write an entire multiplayer 3D game from scratch. Of course doing this from scratch means writing your own game engine: not only writing the custom rendering, but also implementing the physics and the collisions. Well this is what this project is: a complete rewrite of a multiplayer game, minecraft-like.

I did this project with 3 other friends. Over the time of 1 month, we worked on this as often as possible, and finished it over a long hackathon weekend ! 

One of my best programming experience ever.
