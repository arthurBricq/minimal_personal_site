# My old personal website

This website was something I had in my mind since a long time. Doing it fully in React was really a great opportunity to learn more about this framework and about JS.

Eventually, after 2 years of service I got tired of using React (dependency handling is a pain) and I decided to write my custom site in pure html-CSS. But the overall experience remains very positive.
