# Vim-like Text Editor in Rust

Another of my latest personal project, written in Rust. Finding the proper architecture that always to quickly write "editor modes" (like in vim) while providing the most common functionalities of a text editor (copy-pasting, selection, edition, deletion, undo/redo) was a very interesting challenge. I did everything from scratch, without using any outside ressources. Of course, the end result is not a usable text editor (as it does not have many 'advanced' functionalities that are actually super usefull, like syntax highlighting).

I still want to spend some time on this project to documentate the software architecture that I designed to solve this problem.
