### A little bit about me

I am a **software engineer** specialized in robot's localization, but at ease with all aspects of software engineering. Languages where I am the most at ease includes **C++, Java & Python**. Lately, I have been discovering **Rust**  (loved it). I have also done in my past a some Javascript, Matlab, and quite a bit of Swift in my earliest programming experiences. Here, you'll find information about projects that I have done, some ways to contact me, and (maybe if I have time) some thoughts and opinions that I have to share (*As it happens, I am a nature lover that is pretty scared about our future due to the climate crisis and I would like to write about it*)

### Personal links

- [My Github account](https://github.com/arthurBricq) contains the code that I am allowed to share
- [My LinkedIn account](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arthur-bricq-737548153/)
- [My lichess account](https://lichess.org/@/arthurbricq) if you want to play chess games with me ♟️ 

### Even more about me

My **personal taste** includes:
- all kind of carbon-free muscle-powered travels: hiking, trekking, biking, bike touring, ski touring
- programming (I like the most Rust and C++ but really, any kind of programming is cool)
- vim and linux, or better framed: **efficiency**
- endurance sports: running, trail running, cycling
- chess
- (*so, no need to mention chess programming*)
- good beers and good people
- reading books about fantasies or fictions
- reading books about ecology
- camping outside, with or without tent

My **personal dislikes** includes:
- big cars, also called SUVs (*but since they have nothing to do with sport, let's remain with big cars*)
- luxury ski resorts
- infinite scrolling social medias (reels, shorts, tiktoks)

### Why a personal website ?

As you can understand, this personal website is not a resume (*though, you can find my resume here !*), nor is it limited to a port-folio (*though, you find many of my projects here!*). I don't really know what it is about, to be very honnest.

For most of my life, I was considered (and probably still am) as a nerd. **Nerds have persoonal websites !** I have loved technologies for all of my life (especially everything that involves computers), but I am also deeply scared for the future of another one of my favorite things on earth: the earth. Maybe this is a trial to see if I can (to some extremely limited extent) join both attractions.

### More about how this page was built

This is my attempt to write an extremely lightweight, yet pleasant, personal website. It uses only the basics: **HTML**, **CSS** and  **JS without any dependency**. I use to have a personal website (which I was very happy about) written with the [React framework gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/). After not touching the code for 1 year and a half, it happened to have **195 broken dependencies**. Just that. This experience made me mad about the current state of these newly shiny JS frameworks, and I ended up writing a personal website without any JS dependency. All of the text is written in markdown files, that are parsed in python, and then exported in html through a home-made website generator.
