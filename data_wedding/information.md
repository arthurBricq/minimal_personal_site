## Where to sleep in the region

Finding a place to sleep in Castelvecchio itself is unfortunately not very easy.

We are reserving as many private houses as we can, and will propose to as many of you the option to sleep in one of those houses.

- On **January 20th**, we will have the full list of guests.
- By **February 20th**, we will let every attendee whether we managed to find them a room.
- If we did not manage to find you a room, there are many bookable options in **Zucharello** (*15 minutes drive*) or in **Albenga** (*35 minutes drive*)
