## Dress code

ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· Il nâ€™y a aucun dress code pour notre mariage Ã  Castelvecchio, venez comme vous voulez :)
Cependant, gardez Ã  lâ€™esprit quâ€™il pourrait faire trÃ¨s chaud, et que le village ne se prÃªte pas aux talons hauts ni aux chaussures trop rigides ! 

Vous Ãªtes prÃ©venus !

ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹ Non câ€™Ã¨ nessun tipo di dress code per il nostro matrimonio a Castelvecchio, venite come volete :)
Tuttavia, tenete a mente che potrebbe fare molto caldo (uff), e che il paese non si presta a tacchi alti o scarpe troppo rigide! 

Siete stati avvertiti!

ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ There is no dress code for our wedding in Castelvecchio, come as you like :)
However, keep in mind that it might be very hot (phew), and the village is not suitable for high heels or overly rigid shoes! 

You have been warned!

## Where to sleep in the region

Finding a place to sleep in Castelvecchio itself is unfortunately not very easy.

We are reserving as many private houses as we can, and will propose to as many of you the option to sleep in one of those houses.

- On **January 20th**, we will have the full list of guests.
- By **February 20th**, we will let every attendee whether we managed to find them a room.
- If we did not manage to find you a room, there are many bookable options in **Zucharello** (*15 minutes drive*) or in **Albenga** (*35 minutes drive*)
