# Castelvecchio di Rocca Barbena

[Castelvecchio](https://maps.app.goo.gl/rgJZ9FLCdgTvcXxw9) is a small medieval village in the **Ligurian alps**, where Susy grew up and spent many vacations.

It is a very special place for us, not far from the sea and yet in the middle of the Alps. 

Here are a few pictures to motivate you to come !
