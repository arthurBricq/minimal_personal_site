undefined<h1>Applied Data Science</h1>Check out the webpage of this project: <a href="https://arthurbricq.github.io/DiplomacyBetrayals/">click here</a><br />During a course of Data Science at EPFL (CS-401), in a team of 3 students we had to first replicate a paper and then to do a <strong>creative extension</strong> of the results previously illustrated. The bigger part of the project consituted this extension. <br />Our team was assignated a paper about an online strategy game called <strong>Diplomacy</strong>, and we conducted an <em>in depth</em> analysis of this game using a huge dataset that we were glad to acquire online. I was in charge of most of the data processing pipeline to extract meaningful features or plots from this dataset that contained 22'000 games (knowing that each game is... months long !)<br />Check out this video which presents most of the results. <br /><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gfrJvs2dMmM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
