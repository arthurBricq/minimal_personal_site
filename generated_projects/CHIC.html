undefined<h1>China Hardware Innovation Center</h1><strong>China Hardware Innovation Center</strong> (CHIC) was a year and a half long project in a team of 5 skilled students (2 engineers, 2 design students and 1 business student), where we had to entirely designed from scracth a <strong>connected device</strong>, in our case a <strong>smart sensor for home plants</strong>, that can transform any plant into a highly sensitive touch sensor and generate beautiful visuals. <br />For the first year of the program, we worked on the creation of a sensor (3D printed box, PCBs) which allowed minimal viable performances (the sensor could detect when a plant was being touched). The second year of the program was focused on a much more technical aspect: the development of a <strong>new sensing technology</strong> that uses machine learning to not only detect when a plant (<em>or actually, any object</em>) is touched, but to also eventually detect <strong>how or where</strong> the object is being touched. <br /><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/<em>SN1TQER2w4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><br />The work involved <strong>many aspects</strong>, a lot of them being technical: programming microcontrollers, designing PCBs and producing them, fast prototyping.<br /><img src="../images/chic_all_pcb.png" alt=""><br />Though we also had to work in a team and this came with its challenges and many opportunites to work my <strong>soft skills</strong>. This project was definitely one of the highlight of my student career at EPFL. </em>
