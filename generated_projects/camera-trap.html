undefined<h1>Camera Trap with a Rapsberry PI</h1>During the lockdown, I was observing at birds at my window and wondering that I'd like to see them from closer. I also happened to be in possetion of a <strong>Raspberry Pi</strong> with a super cool <strong>Pi camera v2.1 NoIR</strong>.<br />So, with my friend Johan (<em>You can check out his own website, he is a great physicist and my adventure companion, go at this <a href="https://jfelisaz.eu/">link</em></a><em>) we decided to 'build' (</em>that's a big word<em>) a little box, equippe it with: the raspberry pi, some IR lights that we got from some old remotes, the camera and a phone battery. <br /><img src="../images/wildlife_trap.png" alt=""><br />Though it is really not great design (it was mostly for fun), we would take some great pictures of birds and it was a good practise of computer vision. In a few words, the algorithm looked for difference between the <strong>current image</strong> and the <strong>mean image</strong> of the stream. </em>
