undefined<h1>Chess Engine in C++</h1>I have written a fully functional Chess Engine, starting from scratch and using nothing else than the standard library in C++ and SFML for graphics. You can easily try it out in your own computer by compiling the project. <br />It was pretty difficult to finish the project, there was many challenges. Here's a few of the highlights of the project<ul><li>A lot of optimisation was required. Since a chess engine has to go through millions of positions quickly, you have to think about optimisation, a lot ! It was pretty new for me.</li><li>The data-model has to be efficient, but also, easy to use ! The rules of chess are not so trivial, so they have to be thought along with the data-model</li><li>The tree search of the solver, well, is quite a big tree. I have implemented alpha-beta prunning search, and it works pretty well !</li></ul>
