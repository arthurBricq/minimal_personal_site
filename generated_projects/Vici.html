undefined<h1>The Vici project (hackathon)</h1>Vici was realized in a lapse time of 3 days, by the end of the weekend there was a fully functionable iOS app, a website done classicaly (HTML + JS + CSS) and a Python server coded in Django running on a rapsberry pi. Unfortunately, this project wasn't kept alive much longer after the hackathon though you can still access its project page at this <a href="https://devpost.com/software/vici">link</a>. <br />I was in charge of many parts of this project, from ideation to almots all of the iOS programming. The only thing that i didn't take part of was the website development.<br />Also, feel free to check this video presenting the project !<br /><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/t6okgj3G-gM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
