undefined<h1>InTrek, a Strava-like multi-sport application</h1>This project was done for a course at EPFL. In a team of 3 students, we developed an mobile app over Android to be your 'hiking partner'. <br /><img src="../images/intrek0.png" alt=""><br />The app featured a connection with a <strong>smart-watch</strong> to record data such as <strong>chocs</strong> or <strong>average acceleration</strong>. It also used GPS data to compute <strong>speeds</strong> or <strong>distances</strong>. Here are some layouts from the user experience !<br /><img src="../images/intrek3.png" alt="">
