<h3>More about me</h3>
<p>I am a <strong>software engineer</strong> working with robot's localisation, especially with mapping and localisation alogithms. Languages where I am the most at ease includes C++, Java &amp; Python. Lately, I have been discovering Rust and loved the experience. I have also done in my past a some Javascript, Matlab, and quite a bit of Swift in my earliest programming experiences. This is my <strong>personal-website</strong>, for sharing personal stuffs as well as projects that I have liked doing.</p>
<p>I am a nature lover, pretty scared about our future due to the climate crisis. Here, you'll find informations about projects that I have done, some ways to contact me, and (maybe if I have time) some thoughts and opinions that I have to share.</p>
<p>My <strong>personal taste</strong> includes:
- all kind of carbon-free muscle-powered travels: hiking, trekking, biking, bike touring, ski touring
- programming (I like the most Rust and C++ but really, any kind of programming is cool)
- vim and linux, or better framed: <strong>efficiency</strong>
- endurance sports: running, trail running, cycling
- chess
- (<em>so, no need to mention chess programming</em>)
- good beers and good people
- reading books about fantasies or fictions
- reading books about ecology
- camping outside, with or without tent</p>
<p>My <strong>personal dislikes</strong> includes:
- big cars, also called SUVs (<em>but since they have nothing to do with sport, let's remain with big cars</em>)
- luxury ski resorts
- infinite scrolling social medias (reels, shorts, tiktoks)</p>
<h3>Why a personal website ?</h3>
<p>As you can understand, this personal website is not a resume (<em>though, you can find my resume here !</em>), nor is it limited to a port-folio (<em>though, you find many of my projects here!</em>). I don't really know what it is about, to be very honnest.</p>
<p>For most of my life, I was considered (and probably still am) as a nerd. <strong>Nerds have persoonal websites !</strong> I have loved technologies for all of my life (especially everything that involves computers), but I am also deeply scared for the future of another one of my favorite things on earth: the earth. Maybe this is a trial to see if I can (to some extremely limited extent) join both attractions.</p>
<h3>More about how this page was built</h3>
<p>This is my attempt to write an extremely lightweight, yet pleasant, personal website. It uses only the basics: <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong> and  <strong>JS without any dependency</strong>. I use to have a personal website (which I was very happy about) written with the <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/">React framework gatsby</a>. After not touching the code for 1 year and a half, it happened to have <strong>195 broken dependencies</strong>. Just that. This experience made me mad about the current state of these newly shiny JS frameworks, and I ended up writing a personal website without any JS dependency. All of the text is written in markdown files that are parsed using a regex.</p>
