<h3>A little bit about me</h3>
<p>I am a <strong>software engineer</strong> coming from the world of robot's localization, but at ease with all aspects of software
engineering. Now, I am working in the field of distributed computing.</p>
<p>Languages where I am the most at ease includes <strong>C++, Java &amp; Python</strong>. My favorite language is <strong>Rust</strong>,
with which I do all my side-projects.</p>
<p>Here, you'll find some personal projects that I have done, some ways to contact me, and (maybe if I have time) some
thoughts and opinions that I have to share (<em>As it happens, I am a nature lover that is pretty scared about our future
due to the climate crisis and I would like to write about it</em>)</p>
<h3>Personal links</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/arthurBricq">My Github account</a> contains the code that I am allowed to share.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/arthur-bricq-737548153/">My LinkedIn account</a></li>
<li><a href="https://lichess.org/@/arthurbricq">My lichess account</a> if you want to play chess games with me ♟️</li>
</ul>
<h3>Even more about me</h3>
<p>I am passionate about what I do: programming and computer-science. I like the most Rust and C++ but really, any kind of
programming is cool. In the last few years, I programmed in my free time <strong>two chess engines</strong> with a UI to play with
them, a <strong>text editor</strong>, a <strong>3D game-engine</strong>, a <strong>website generator</strong> (<em>used to build this site</em>), participated in
several coding challenges such as <strong>advent-of-codes</strong>, the google's FooBar challenge or Euler project.</p>
<p>In the rest of my free time, I like</p>
<ul>
<li>All kind of carbon-free muscle-powered travels: hiking, trekking, biking, bike touring, ski touring</li>
<li>Endurance sports: running, trail running, cycling</li>
<li>Photography</li>
<li>Playing chess</li>
<li>Reading books about fantasies or fictions or ecology</li>
<li>Good beers, good people, good coffee</li>
<li>Camping outside, with or without tent</li>
</ul>
<h3>Why a personal website ?</h3>
<p>As you can understand, this personal website is not a resume (<em>though, you can find my resume here !</em>), nor is it
limited to a port-folio (<em>though, you find many of my projects here!</em>). I don't really know what it is about, to be very
honest.</p>
<p>For most of my life, I was considered (and probably still am) as a nerd. <strong>Nerds have personal websites</strong>! I have loved
technologies for all of my life (especially everything that involves computers), but I am also deeply scared for the
future of another one of my favorite things on earth: the earth. Maybe this is a trial to see if I can (to some
extremely limited extent) join both attractions.</p>
<h3>More about how this page was built</h3>
<p>This is my attempt to write an <strong>extremely lightweight</strong>, yet pleasant, personal website. It uses only the basics: *
<em>HTML<strong>, *</strong></em>CSS</p> and (at the moment) not a single JS file. All of the this website is automatically generated from
sources written in markdown, that are parsed using a small python script and then exported to their .html equivalent.
<p>I use to have a personal website (which I was very happy about) written with
the <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/">React framework gatsby</a>. After not touching the code for 1 year and a half, it happened
to have <strong>195 broken dependencies</strong>. Just that. This experience made me mad about the current state of these newly shiny
JS frameworks, and I ended up writing a personal website without any JS dependency.</p>
<p>It's simple. It works today. It would have worked 10 years ago. I hope it will work in 10 years.</p>
