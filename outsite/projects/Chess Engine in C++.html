<h1>Chess Engine in C++</h1>
<p>I have written a fully functional Chess Engine, starting from scratch and using nothing else than the standard library in C++ and SFML for graphics. You can easily try it out in your own computer by compiling the project. </p>
<p>It was pretty difficult to finish the project, there was many challenges. Here's a few of the highlights of the project
- A lot of optimisation was required. Since a chess engine has to go through millions of positions quickly, you have to think about optimisation, a lot ! It was pretty new for me.
- The data-model has to be efficient, but also, easy to use ! The rules of chess are not so trivial, so they have to be thought along with the data-model
- The tree search of the solver, well, is quite a big tree. I have implemented alpha-beta prunning search, and it works pretty well !</p>
