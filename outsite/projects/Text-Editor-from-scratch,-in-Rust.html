<h1>Vim-like Text Editor in Rust</h1>
<p>Another of my latest personal project, written in Rust. Finding the proper architecture that always to quickly write "editor modes" (like in vim) while providing the most common functionalities of a text editor (copy-pasting, selection, edition, deletion, undo/redo) was a very interesting challenge. I did everything from scratch, without using any outside ressources. Of course, the end result is not a usable text editor (as it does not have many 'advanced' functionalities that are actually super usefull, like syntax highlighting).</p>
<p>I still want to spend some time on this project to documentate the software architecture that I designed to solve this problem.</p>
