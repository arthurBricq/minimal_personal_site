			<h1>Personal Projects</h1>

			<p>Here, you will find some of my personal projects.</p>

			<p>Programming has always been a hobby for me, and since pretty much always I have enjoyed working on sides projects. I am not sure why I like so much to spend time on these projects, I know of course that most likely nobody will ever use them, but I guess that I just like to build things with computers. I also really like Rust and C++. And I like to learn about topics that I don't know. Oh, and I like chess engines too.</p>

			<p>So here's a little list with links to my repos !</p>
