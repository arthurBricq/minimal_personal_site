<h1>Chess Engine in C++</h1>
<p>I have written a fully functional Chess Engine, starting from scratch and using nothing else than the standard library in C++ and SFML for graphics. You can easily try it out in your own computer by compiling the project. </p>
<p>It was pretty difficult to finish the project, there was many challenges. Here's a few of the highlights of the project
- A lot of optimisation was required. Since a chess engine has to go through millions of positions quickly, you have to think about optimisation, a lot ! It was pretty new for me.
- The data-model has to be efficient, but also, easy to use ! The rules of chess are not so trivial, so they have to be thought along with the data-model
- The tree search of the solver, well, is quite a big tree. I have implemented alpha-beta prunning search, and it works pretty well !</p>
<h1>The Vici project (hackathon)</h1>
<p>Vici was realized in a lapse time of 3 days, by the end of the weekend there was a fully functionable iOS app, a website done classicaly (HTML + JS + CSS) and a Python server coded in Django running on a rapsberry pi. Unfortunately, this project wasn't kept alive much longer after the hackathon though you can still access its project page at this <a href="https://devpost.com/software/vici">link</a>. </p>
<p>I was in charge of many parts of this project, from ideation to almots all of the iOS programming. The only thing that i didn't take part of was the website development.</p>
<p>Also, feel free to check this video presenting the project !</p>

<h1>Image Analysis Course Project</h1>
<p>The work involved to work with videos in Python, <strong>Object Extraction</strong> using state of the art computer vision to detect numbers and operators on the ground and <strong>Object Classification</strong> using a tuned Neural Network that is color independant and rotation invariant, using several Deep Learning methods.</p>
<h1>Robottle</h1>
<p>Robottle was made for an academic event hosted at EPFL, where autonomous robots have to collect plastic bottles in a random environement and bring them back to a recycling area.</p>
<p>Our robot featured <strong>states of the art</strong> technologies, including a <strong>Lidar</strong> to run <strong>SLAM</strong> algorithm, a camera with <strong>Deep Neural Network</strong> for object recognition. You can see more about our robot with this video that we made to illustrate our project.</p>
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XJpJSuhSZN4" width="560"></iframe>
<p>After I was contacted by NVIDEA developer teams, Robottle became a showcased project and gained its own little referenced on the NVIDEA official <a href="website">https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/community/jetson-projects#robottle</a></p>
<h1>Applied Data Science</h1>
<p>Check out the webpage of this project: <a href="https://arthurbricq.github.io/DiplomacyBetrayals/">click here</a></p>
<p>During a course of Data Science at EPFL (CS-401), in a team of 3 students we had to first replicate a paper and then to do a <strong>creative extension</strong> of the results previously illustrated. The bigger part of the project consituted this extension. </p>
<p>Our team was assignated a paper about an online strategy game called <strong>Diplomacy</strong>, and we conducted an <em>in depth</em> analysis of this game using a huge dataset that we were glad to acquire online. I was in charge of most of the data processing pipeline to extract meaningful features or plots from this dataset that contained 22'000 games (knowing that each game is... months long !)</p>
<p>Check out this video which presents most of the results. </p>

<h1>Camera Trap with a Rapsberry PI</h1>
<p>During the lockdown, I was observing at birds at my window and wondering that I'd like to see them from closer. I also happened to be in possetion of a <strong>Raspberry Pi</strong> with a super cool <strong>Pi camera v2.1 NoIR</strong>.</p>
<p>So, with my friend Johan (<em>You can check out his own website, he is a great physicist and my adventure companion, go at this <a href="https://jfelisaz.eu/">link</a></em>) we decided to 'build' (<em>that's a big word</em>) a little box, equippe it with: the raspberry pi, some IR lights that we got from some old remotes, the camera and a phone battery. </p>
<p><img alt="" src="../images/wildlife_trap.png"/></p>
<p>Though it is really not great design (it was mostly for fun), we would take some great pictures of birds and it was a good practise of computer vision. In a few words, the algorithm looked for difference between the <strong>current image</strong> and the <strong>mean image</strong> of the stream. </p>
<h1>Chess Engine in Rust</h1>
<p>I wanted to learn Rust, and I had loved to write my first chess engine (in C++). So this is my attempt to do it in Rust. It was surprisingly easier than C++.</p>
<p>With this engine, I choose a memory efficient representation of a chess-board: 7 integers are sufficient to represent a full chess position (including the special rules for castling and for en-passant). Using such a low-memory approach, it's extremely cheap to perform deep copies of chess games and therefore have a simple chess solver.</p>
<h1>Mine Hunter</h1>
<p>When I started working on this project, I knew not much about programming, Swift, or software construction. It took my brother and I more than a year of learning to have this game. </p>
<p><img alt="" src="../images/minehunter.png"/></p>
<p>It is a remake version of the famous game 'Mine Sweeper' that included the following features:
- 2 new kind of blocks: hexagonals and triangulars 
- infinite games or a story of several puzzles
- additional difficulties</p>
<p>Working with the design of this game was very difficult ! The geometry of the game is really not so trivial when it was about hundreds of triangles. Unfortunately, the game is not available in the AppStore because one has to pay each and every year for that. But you have access to all the code, and it really works !</p>
<h1>My old personal website</h1>
<p>This website was something I had in my mind since a long time. Doing it fully in React was really a great opportunity. </p>
<h1>InTrek, a Strava-like multi-sport application</h1>
<p>This project was done for a course at EPFL. In a team of 3 students, we developed an mobile app over Android to be your 'hiking partner'. </p>
<p><img alt="" src="../images/intrek0.png"/></p>
<p>The app featured a connection with a <strong>smart-watch</strong> to record data such as <strong>chocs</strong> or <strong>average acceleration</strong>. It also used GPS data to compute <strong>speeds</strong> or <strong>distances</strong>. Here are some layouts from the user experience !</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../images/intrek3.png"/></p>
<h1>Minimal Gauss-Newton solver</h1>
<p>I did this super simple solver to explore the mechanics of the Gauss-Newton algorithm in need of understanding. This was the result of this work. The only depandency is <code>numpy</code> and it is absolutely easy to use it.</p>
<h1>China Hardware Innovation Center</h1>
<p><strong>China Hardware Innovation Center</strong> (CHIC) was a year and a half long project in a team of 5 skilled students (2 engineers, 2 design students and 1 business student), where we had to entirely designed from scracth a <strong>connected device</strong>, in our case a <strong>smart sensor for home plants</strong>, that can transform any plant into a highly sensitive touch sensor and generate beautiful visuals. </p>
<p>For the first year of the program, we worked on the creation of a sensor (3D printed box, PCBs) which allowed minimal viable performances (the sensor could detect when a plant was being touched). The second year of the program was focused on a much more technical aspect: the development of a <strong>new sensing technology</strong> that uses machine learning to not only detect when a plant (<em>or actually, any object</em>) is touched, but to also eventually detect <strong>how or where</strong> the object is being touched. </p>
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_SN1TQER2w4" width="560"></iframe>
<p>The work involved <strong>many aspects</strong>, a lot of them being technical: programming microcontrollers, designing PCBs and producing them, fast prototyping.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../images/chic_all_pcb.png"/></p>
<p>Though we also had to work in a team and this came with its challenges and many opportunites to work my <strong>soft skills</strong>. This project was definitely one of the highlight of my student career at EPFL. </p>
