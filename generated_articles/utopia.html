<h1>The utopia of a nature-loving software engineer</h1>This is a WORK IN PROGRESS.<h2>About why we need utopias</h2><blockquote>Or about why am I writing this...</blockquote><br />I will not dive in too much to answer the question: <strong>why do we need utopias?</strong>. This question has been answered by many specialists. The main idea of their answers is that creating utopias is the first step to<h2>A quick description of where I want to go</h2>First things first, let's state the obvious: if we are to design an utopia, it must be one that includes everyone (that is, the 10 billions of human that will live on this planet). There is no such utopia that includes the mass reduction of the human population on the short term (<em>for some ecologists, this is not always the case...</em>)<br />A world in which cities are a nice place to live in: without air pollution, noises from heavy cars or angry drivers, green streets with safe bike lines. Cities provide a rich diversity of local businesses: arts centers, music schools, gardens, sports centers ; but also board game coffees, retro and post-modern programming squares, maker-spaces with reusable components; exchanging and repairing centers.<br />Traveling would mostly be done by trains and night trains where it would be easy to transport you own bike. Each city would provide a rich public transport network. Of course, rural areas will keep the need to have cars, it is difficult to picture a world without them. However, such cars would not be personals (meaning, it won't be up to the individuals to cover their expenses of fixing and consumption), but will be rather part of a shared (<em>and eventually autonomous</em>) car network adapted to the rural that will be an extra expense. If buses and trains are free within big cities, so should these shared car for rural.<br />The eduction of each citizen would be driven around different 'axis' as those of todays: empathy, awareness of our environment, creativity & curiosity ; instead of what I was given in my republican education: productivity, competitivity, valuing of hard-workers.<br />Another one of the myth of today's education system is that "if you are a good student (<em>and later on, a good citizen</em>), school (<em>and later, society</em>) will reward you with good grades (<em>and later, salaries</em>)". With this mindset on, there is no need for independence: the free-market will provide you with everything that you want, as long as you provide free-market a profitable work. Actually, all of our societies revolves around a massive inter-dependency of all the components of the global society. In my utopia, dependency would be one of the core of the education given to citizens: things such as growing vegetables, cooking them, fixing your electrical installation or water system, cutting wood and replanting it, traveling by bike & fixing it, ect, would be part of the "citizen package".<br />The value of work would completely change. Work would not longer be the reason of our lives, nor the reason why society should reward us. Work would be not oriented towards <em>growth</em>, but rather towards the feeling of <em>utility</em> while keeping a focus on <em>satisfaction</em>. If we stop reasoning in terms of always maximizing the growth, the need of work will drastically reduce. And that's not even considering the fact that humanity has developed many technologies that were <em>initially</em> developed to reduce the amount of human work (<em>though, the initial intentions are questionable...</em>) With the help of robotics, computer vision, & AI at our service, we could heavily reduce the amount of proper human work required, while still producing enough food for everyone ; all of which <strong>without destroying our planet</strong>. <br />Money would be much better shared, to limit advantages given at birth to kids with rich families. The concrete case of communism seems to show that complete sharing of profits is not likely to work. But there is a big spectrum between one utopia where everything is fully shared (communism) and one where everything is fully inherited (capitalism).<br /><blockquote>TODO: write about the fact that there will still be most of what we have today, hospitals, factories, ... But with an output limited to what is required</blockquote><h2>About the role of technologies</h2>With all of this in mind, "<em>what role to give to technologies</em>" ? In a way, this question is similar to "<em>what is the link between growth and progress ?</em>". <br />I personally like technologies, I always have. Not that I am not scared of all of them, but I deeply like the idea that there is a human force working towards progress, for the progress of Science. And it is undeniable that this progress is associated and linked with the growth of our societies: growth demanded by big companies has driven a lot of the latest progress: computers technologies, including hardware progress, but also the latest development of AI. <br />Let's state the obvious (that is not so obvious): <strong>technologies will not help us through this mess, if used within the same framework as they are today</strong>: an absolute free market. Growth supported by multi nationals and governments resulted in both a huge technological progress and a huge climate crisis. The state of technology and the state of the earth have a common cause: our societal quest for economical growth. So the question can be reframed to what I think is a much easier one: "<em>can something else that economic growth drive a coherent research effort ?</em>". Of course it can be ! What about passion ? What about curiosity ? For centuries, these have been the motors of scientific discovery. This may seem obvious but the consequence of such an observation are huge : technology itself is not responsible for the climate crisis, therefore we can keep it. <br />Us the technology lovers, should be careful to not be manipulated by those who are fighting for the cause of growth. They will come and declare themselves as protectors of technology. There is room for technology and progress in the new world that we are about to create ! Actually, I believe these guys have stolen from us one of the myth behind technological progress: that progress should help humanity to work  with better conditions and essentially less, leaving us with more time to care about ourselves and our communities. Now that we have robots able to do so many autonomous tasks, that computers are able to help us with pretty much every single administration duty, that our electrical and heating technologies have allowed us for never-reached efficiency, and that it has never been easier to produce energy, how come do we still work as much as we do ? How come so many workers that are most required by our society (farmers, nurses, garbage man, firefighters, but also public doctors, teachers, and many more) are complaining about their working conditions, with extremely high burn-out rate ? It seems to me that priorities have not been given properly, that the developed technologies have been misused intentionally by the governing cast.<br />It is time to reappropriate technologies for our cause ! There is so much talent working out there for the wrong causes. What if the workforce that is currently designing the meta-verse, or some new kind of tik-tok video formats, would spend its time working on improving the working conditions of nurses in times of crisis ? What if the research efforts towards bigger cars was used to see how we can help farmers in their transition from an old agricultural model to a fully organic one ? There could be many more examples like this one, my message is that we need not to abandon technologies behind us in this transition. <strong>The values driving research must be questioned and changed</strong>, but the nerds of all ages like me don't have to worry: there will be a ton of exciting projects to work with.<h2>To conclude</h2>I am aware that reaching this society is most likely impossible, for the following reasons<ul><li>The forces acting against such a vision are strong and coordinated.</li><li>There is still roughly more than half of the world that lives in terrible conditions and have more important figths to lead than this one.</li><li>Even in places where the conditions are good enough to lead such fight, most people are not willing to do it.</li></ul>
 
However, I wanted to have this written down, for I care a lot about it; for there is a small chance that my utopia can convince you that <strong>there is a lot win</strong>; for if we don't dream even in the darkest hour, we loose hope that is the fuel for action.
