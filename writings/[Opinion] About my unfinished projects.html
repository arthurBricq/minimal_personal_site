<h1>Unfinished projects are great</h1>
<p>Unfinished projects are great ! </p>
<p>My list of unfinished project is big. I have programmed 2 chess engines, a text-editor, a game-engine, a parser-interpreter, countless websites, python scripts, toy-games. Even this website is generated by one of my unfinished project: a website generator from static sources. And I intend to keep making it bigger and bigger, for it is what I value the most with programming: the <strong>art of exploring what computers can do</strong>.</p>
<p>By <em>unfinished</em>, I mean <em>not usable by someone else than myself</em>. I don't mean <em>useless</em> or <em>valueless</em>. </p>
<p>Coming in the world of software engineering without a computer-science related diploma (<em>I am a mechanical engineer with a master in Robotics</em>), these projects taught me a bunch of things, ranging from algorithms (on the top of my head: alpha-beta pruning, binary-space-partitioning, polygon splitting, max-flow solutions, shortest path), to advanced data-structure, programming techniques, languages (<em>Rust</em> !). </p>
<p>Beside being part of the learning-path, these projects are just fun. They are what keeps me passionate. How many discussions did I have, with my friends or colleague, about them. </p>
<p>Please, share me with what you did not finish but were excited about enough to start it !</p>
<h1>What about big code-base, what real software engineering ...</h1>
<p>Of course that as a software developer, finishing the "last 10%" of projects is extremely important. It may as well be the hardest part.</p>
<p>But this is what jobs are for ! In my experience at least, <strong>working as a software engineer means working on the last 10% while considering the first 90% as a de-facto condition for every development</strong>.</p>
<p><img alt="ABC" src="../images/personal-projects.png"/></p>
<p>Here's a little curve that shows what I think are the 3 zones of a project. As explained, the last 10% requires a full-time job. It consists in a lot of bug-fixing, upgrading dependencies, and refactoring to include newer features. </p>
<p>But working only on these last 10% is taking a risk for your passion. Let's be honest, it is for the first 50-60 percent that we first started programming. They are the best. The dopamine of coding ! When you can <em>just add features</em> without having to rename 3 classes, fix 26 broken tests, counter-review commit message and waiting for your CI builds.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong. There are many great things about working with finished projects ! But In my case, I find that my <strong>small</strong> to <strong>not-so-small</strong> unfinished projects are what keeps me fresh and fast to show every day at work and give my best.</p>
<h1>Note to self: ideas for the future</h1>
<p>Here's a list of small (or not-so-small) projects that I wish I had time to start.</p>
<ul>
<li>A new, faster and better, <strong>chess-engine</strong> ! I start to understand well how these work, I have ideas on how to make them faster.</li>
<li>Something in Rust with <strong>web-assembly</strong>. Don't know what yet.</li>
<li>Fast <strong>game-of-life</strong></li>
<li>An <strong>Oberon</strong> interpret (<em>this one, I am already working on it!</em>)</li>
<li>An <strong>Oberon</strong> transpiler</li>
<li>A <strong>go-engine</strong>, because I am curious on how you would approach the problem (<em>chess-like approach won't work, since there is no obvious score evaluation that I am aware of</em>)</li>
</ul>
