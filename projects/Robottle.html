<h1>Robottle</h1>
<p>Robottle was made for an academic event hosted at EPFL, where autonomous robots have to collect plastic bottles in a random environement and bring them back to a recycling area.</p>
<p>Our robot featured <strong>states of the art</strong> technologies, including a <strong>Lidar</strong> to run <strong>SLAM</strong> algorithm, a camera with <strong>Deep Neural Network</strong> for object recognition. You can see more about our robot with this video that we made to illustrate our project.</p>
