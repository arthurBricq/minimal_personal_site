<h1>Custom Game Engine framework</h1>
<p><em>WORK IN PROGRESS</em></p>
<p>I the quest for a new project, I have decided to program a Doom game. When I explored the several options in Rust to write OpenGL or Vulkan bindings, I was slightly disappointed. I though it would a great idea to try and <strong>write a custom game engine</strong>. Since it is quite a challenging piece of work, I limited myself to a <strong>CPU engine</strong> (no hardware acceleration <em>yet</em>).</p>
<p>The current state of the engine is to display any kind of cube-base objects, supporting textures. To render 3D objects, I work at the pixel level : for each pixel of the screen, I perform <strong>ray-tracing</strong> to determine <em>which face is the closest to the camera</em>. Once a face is determined, I use its texture to determine which RGB color must be written at this pixel. I am currently working on <strong>binary space partitioning</strong> to accelerate the visual processing when there are hundreds / thousands of objects to display.</p>
<p>When this will be finished, I will use it to write my own <strong>Doom</strong>.</p>
