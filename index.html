<h3>A little bit about me</h3>
<p>I am a <strong>software engineer</strong> specialized in robot's localization, but at ease with all aspects of software engineering. Languages where I am the most at ease includes <strong>C++, Java &amp; Python</strong>. Lately, I have been discovering <strong>Rust</strong> (loving it). I have also done in my past a some Javascript, Matlab, and quite a bit of Swift in my earliest programming experiences. Here, you'll find information about projects that I have done, some ways to contact me, and (maybe if I have time) some thoughts and opinions that I have to share (<em>As it happens, I am a nature lover that is pretty scared about our future due to the climate crisis and I would like to write about it</em>)</p>
<h3>Personal links</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/arthurBricq">My Github account</a> contains the code that I am allowed to share</li>
<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/arthur-bricq-737548153/">My LinkedIn account</a></li>
<li><a href="https://lichess.org/@/arthurbricq">My lichess account</a> if you want to play chess games with me ♟️ </li>
</ul>
<h3>Even more about me</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Everything that is simple is powerful</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My <strong>personal taste</strong> includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>All kind of computer-science topics (<em>I do spend quite some time on hackernews everyday</em>)</li>
<li>Programming (I like the most Rust and C++ but really, any kind of programming is cool). In the last few years, I programmed in my free time <strong>two chess engines</strong> with a UI to play, a <strong>text editor</strong>, participated in several <strong>advent-of-code</strong>, several mobile apps, this website that you are reading.</li>
<li>Vim and linux, or better framed: <strong>efficiency</strong></li>
<li>All kind of carbon-free muscle-powered travels: hiking, trekking, biking, bike touring, ski touring</li>
<li>Endurance sports: running, trail running, cycling</li>
<li>Playing chess</li>
<li>Good beers and good people</li>
<li>Reading books about fantasies or fictions or ecology</li>
<li>Camping outside, with or without tent</li>
</ul>
<p>My <strong>personal dislikes</strong> includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>infinite scrolling social medias (reels, shorts, tiktoks)</li>
<li>big cars, also called SUVs (<em>but since they have nothing to do with sport, let's remain with big cars</em>)</li>
<li>luxury ski resorts</li>
</ul>
<h3>Why a personal website ?</h3>
<p>As you can understand, this personal website is not a resume (<em>though, you can find my resume here !</em>), nor is it limited to a port-folio (<em>though, you find many of my projects here!</em>). I don't really know what it is about, to be very honnest.</p>
<p>For most of my life, I was considered (and probably still am) as a nerd. <strong>Nerds have persoonal websites !</strong> I have loved technologies for all of my life (especially everything that involves computers), but I am also deeply scared for the future of another one of my favorite things on earth: the earth. Maybe this is a trial to see if I can (to some extremely limited extent) join both attractions.</p>
<h3>More about how this page was built</h3>
<p>This is my attempt to write an <strong>extremely lightweight</strong>, yet pleasant, personal website. It uses only the basics: <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong> and (at the moment) not a single JS file. All of the this website is automatically generated from sources written in markdown, that are parsed using a small python script and then exported to their .html equivalent.</p>
<p>I use to have a personal website (which I was very happy about) written with the <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/">React framework gatsby</a>. After not touching the code for 1 year and a half, it happened to have <strong>195 broken dependencies</strong>. Just that. This experience made me mad about the current state of these newly shiny JS frameworks, and I ended up writing a personal website without any JS dependency.</p>
<p>It's simple. It works today. It would have worked 10 years ago. I hope it will work in 10 years.</p>
